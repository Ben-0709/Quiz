Hi everyone!
In this code I tried to create a quiz which has different 15 questions with 3 choices.
It is possible to scroll forward and backward through all questions.
You can see exactly what question you gotta.
During the quiz, you can reset all already marked questions and start all over again.
When you click on the "Reset" button, a window modal opens with the message:
"Are you sure you want to reset the quiz", at this time there's an option to reset or cancel it.
If any question isn't answered, you'll be notified that all questions must be answered.
At the end of the quiz you see your result. At different points you see different congratulatory messages.
And if you didn’t answer any question, you get a message that you didn’t answer any question! Try again.
And after completing each quiz, you can click on the button and try again!

I hope you enjoy my version of the quiz.
I wish you'll happy coding.
